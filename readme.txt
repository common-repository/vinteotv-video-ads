Yes, for both desktop and mobile web we accept any size banner that is at minimum 250 width and 170 height.

= How much revenue will I generate? =

The CPM is determined by many factors such as: size of the banner, geo, your domain Alexa rank, time on site and the environment you are running the tag. Although CPM rates cannot be guaranteed, our advanced optimization tools enable us to maximize the value of your traffic and achieve the best result possible.

We care for our publisher's property, hence we carefully review each and every ad before it is added to our demand. We never accept suggestive or malicious content from our advertisers.

Sure! We also offer tags that are fully compatible with DFP.

= How and when will I get paid? =

We pay either via PayPal or Bank wire on a Net 30 basis (30 days from the end of the previous calendar month, given the invoice is received on time). There is no minimum payout for PayPal payments and only $500 for Bank wires (if the balance is lower the amount is carried to the next payment cycle).

= What type of traffic is allowed? =

We have a zero tolerance policy for any bot, invalid, fraudulent, malicious, masked, or adult traffic of any kind.  Our system scans every publisher in real time and publishers suspected of running traffic in violation of our policies will have their tags deactivated and their revenues withheld.
